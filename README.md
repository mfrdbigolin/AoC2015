# *AoC2015*: Advent of Code 2015 C++ Solutions

My    C++     solutions    to    the     very    first    [Advent     of    Code
2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) (i.e., *AoC2015*) some years too late.

When working on my solutions, I strive to make them as general as possible, that
is, they could be adapted to solve similar problems.  Elegance, readability, and
efficiency,  in  this  order,  are  also my  concerns,  though  secondary  after
generality.

## Dependencies

Install the following libraries, if needed:

* [`libcrypto` and  `libssl`](https://www.openssl.org): used to compute  the MD5
  hash function in day four.

## Building

Use `make` to build the program; the executable file `advent` will be located in
the `bin` directory.  To clean the output directories, use `make clean`.

## Usage

The general usage of `advent`, for a particular *DAY*, is

* `advent `*`DAY`*

Additionally,  if you  have another  input for  a particular  day stored  in the
`inputs`â€™  folder, name  it  in the  format `day`*`DAY`*`.`*`EXT`*`.txt`,  where
*EXT* is  any arbitrary extension.  To use  it, append *EXT*  to the end  of the
command, like this:

* `advent `*`DAY`*` `*`EXT`*
